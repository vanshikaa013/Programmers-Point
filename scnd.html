            <h1>What is a programming <br> language?
            </h1>
            <p>At its core, a programming language is a set of instructions that enables humans to communicate with
                computers—using a series of symbols that serve as a bridge that allows humans to turn our ideas
                into instructions computers can understand.
                Like spoken languages, each language has its own unique syntax, structure,
                vocabulary, and even slang or shortcuts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container-2">
            <h1>How do programming <br>languages work?
            </h1>
            <p>A programming language provides a structured mechanism for defining pieces of data, and the
                operations or transformations that may be carried out automatically on that data. A programmer uses
                the abstractions present in the language to represent the concepts involved in a computation. 
                These concepts are represented as a collection of the simplest elements available (called
                primitives)</p>

                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-arrow-right"></i> Writing the code..</h2>
                <p>Everything starts with code. Developers write lines of instructions, expressing their logic and
                    intentions in a programming language, using a text editor or an integrated development environment
                    (IDE).
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-arrow-right"></i> Compilation vs. interpretation</h2>
                <p>Once code is written, it undergoes either compilation or interpretation, depending on the type of
                    programming language used Compiled languages like C++ convert the entire code into machine-readable
                    binary before execution. Interpreted languages like Python translate code line by line during
                    runtime.

            <div class="card">
                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-arrow-right"></i> Execution</h2>
                <p> The compiled or interpreted code is executed by the computer, carrying out the specified
                    instructions and producing the desired output. Code review helps to improve code quality and promote
                    discussion among team members.

            <div class="card">
                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-arrow-right"></i> Runtime errors</h2>
                <p>During execution, some instructions may get "lost in translation." Runtime errors can range from
                    logical mistakes in the code to unforeseen issues. Debugging becomes the detective work of
                    identifying and fixing these errors.

                <p>Debugging is the process of finding and resolving errors in code. Developers use code review tools
                    and techniques to trace issues, ensuring the software behaves as intended, as well as to

            <p>Individuals can explore and use multiple coding languages, which each include different features,
                difficulty levels, and uses. Below, discover some of the most useful coding languages you can learn.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <h3>* What is C?</h3>
                    <p>This general-purpose coding language allows developers to create operating systems, apps,
                        databases, and programs. C requires an underlying knowledge of how computer systems work, making
                        it more challenging to learn than some other coding languages. Coders who master C will likely
                        find it easier to learn other computer programming languages.</p>
                    <h3>* Why Should We Learn C?</h3>
                    <p>Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C language.
                        Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on the C
                        language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (Only a few programs may compile in C, but not
                        in C++).

                        So, if a person learns C programming first, it will help him to learn any modern programming
                        language as well. As learning C help to understand a lot of the underlying architecture of the
                        operating system. Like pointers, working with memory locations, etc.</p>

                        for developing video games, databases, and software. Developers created C++ as a simplified
                        version of C.</p>
                    <h3>* Why should we learn c++?</h3>
                    <p>C++ programming language is almost everywhere around the world. For example, it is used for
                        making browsers, applications, and software. Also, C++ is used majorly to make operating
                        systems, and almost all operating systems are built using C++, for example, Mac Os, Windows,
                        Linux, etc.

                        Browsers like Safari, Opera, Chrome, Firefox, etc., are written in C++ because it is a fast and
                        efficient language that is why it is preferable.
